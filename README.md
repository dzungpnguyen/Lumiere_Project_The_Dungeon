# The-Dungeon

This project consists of programming an agent who moves in a “dungeon” (here modeled by a graph).<br>
The first part only considers the movement of the agent which is entirely “driven” by the user of the system.<br>
The second part adds elements to the labyrinth: treasures and static monsters.<br>
The third part provides the first elements of autonomy for the adventurer.<br>
The fourth part gives some ideas to go further in the development of this application.
